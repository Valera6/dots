# Shell Harpoon

## Usage
```bash
,ui
```
to edit binds

```bash
,h
,t
,n
,s
```
or whatever else the chosen binds are to execute the actions bound to them

And
```bash
,add
``` to connect `,c` to the current dir

## Requirements
The tool is currently designed for personal use only, so `,c` will break in absence of the custom `cs` command (that does `cd` and then some things)
